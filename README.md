# Glassmorphism
Flutter UI Trend. 

Glassmorphism is a term used to describe UI design that emphasises light or dark objects, placed on top of colourful backgrounds. A background-blur is placed on the objects which allows the background to shine through â€“ giving it the impression of frosted glass.

Build your apps with classic UI designs that make your platform <b>'pop'</b>.

Enjoy :)
